Title: A Framework for Incorporating a Fully Integrated Bayesian Approach to Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation in Middle Income Country Contexts

This code repository stores a replicated Cost-Effectiveness Analysis that was used to explore the strengths of a fully integrated Bayesian Posterior simulation approach to Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. The original study used Deterministic Sensitivity Analysis (DSA) and was developed by Sinanovic E., et al. (2009) titled "The potential cost-effectiveness of adding a human papillomavirus vaccine to the cervical cancer screening programme in South Africa." 

This dissertation argues that the flexibility and parsimonious nature of an MCMC approach comparative to other Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) methods to CEA are clear, especially for contexts with limited data; high decision uncertainty; highly constrained health budgets; and thus relatively higher opportunity costs. Nevertheless, the complexity of the MCMC approach, as well as the resource demands that are required to implement it, necessitates a careful deliberation of the decision context and the pros and cons of employing different sensitivity analysis methods. Specifically, the replication exercise used in this study evidenced how, despite the high informational uncertainty, the original DSA adequately answered decision problem, as the assessment was for a relatively minor investment. Accordingly, the study proposes a practical framework for choosing appropriate sensitivity analysis methods in Middle-Income Country contexts that weights various characteristics of a decision problem to help streamline the selection of sensitivity analysis as well as the process of knowledge translation between the analyst and decision-maker.

## Note
Before running the model, ensure that your working directory is set to where the directory of the .Rproj folder is saved on your computer in Rstudio. The easiest way to do this is by pressing Ctrl + Shift + H.

The code style follows coding framework proposed by Alarid-Escudero et al., 2019 "A Need for Change! A Coding Framework for Improving Transparency in Decision Modeling".
